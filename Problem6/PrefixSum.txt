Prefix Sum
To calculate the prefix sum of an array we just need to grab the previous value of the prefix sum and add the current value of the traversed array. The idea behind is that in the previous position of the prefix array we will have the sum of the previous elements. This becomes really helpful because if you want to know what is the total sum up to certain point, you can just check for the value in the prefix sum array. Another use for this programming tool is when you want to know the value between two positions in the array, without the need of going through each item in the array you can just do a calculation from the values in the prefix sum array, reducing complexity and therefor saving time and money. Without any fuss or delay let me show you how can you get the prefix sum array.
